# Dragon Radar

Do you miss Dragon Ball? 
Bring it to life again! 
Explore the world, or a part of it, rescue all the 7 orbs, summon Shenlong and ask him whatever you want. Ready to play? 

Aim of this project is the realization of a multi-player game in which an organizer hides 7 orbs in a map (Google Map) and a team of players searches for them.
They will use their smartphones (iPhone, at the moment) as "Dragon radar" to find the magical objects, when close to one of them they will see it in AR, just "in front" of them.
